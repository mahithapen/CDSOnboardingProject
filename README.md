# CDSOnboardingProject

We used the dataset ml-25m from MovieLens(http://movielens.org). We used a classification model to separate the dataset into “good” movies and “bad” movies using genome tags and their relevance. Then, we used a neural network to predict the ratings of a given movie based on its associated genome tags and average consumer rating.

In order to run our program, please download the following files: genome-tags.csv, movies.csv, genome-scores.csv, ratings.csv.
